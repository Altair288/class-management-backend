# 1. Project Background & Motivation

### Why Build This Project?

Modern education requires the management of student data, attendance, grades, communication, scheduling, and resources. Traditional paper-based workflows or scattered Excel files result in:

* Data inconsistency
* Low efficiency
* Difficulties in tracking updates
* Communication delays

This project provides a unified digital platform for **administrators, teachers, and students** to streamline class-related tasks.

### Core Goals

* **Increase efficiency** via process automation
* **Centralize student data** into a secure database
* **Improve communication** using a real-time message center
* **Enhance user experience** with a responsive UI and modern system design

## 2.3 Architecture & Development Workflow

### Database Design

* Third-normal-form schema
* Core tables: `users`, `roles`, `messages`, `files`, `grades`, etc.
* Managed by Flyway (`V1__baseline.sql`, `V2__seed_data.sql`, …)

### Backend Architecture

* Layered design:
  `Controller → Service → Repository`
* Implemented MessageCenter module
* Integrated MinIO-based file services
* Multi-environment config (`dev`, `prod`)

### Frontend Development

* Next.js + TypeScript project structure
* Reusable layout components
* Responsive UI for PC & Mobile
* Global notification system via Context API

### Deployment

* Docker Compose: backend + frontend + MySQL + MinIO
* Nginx reverse proxy for routing and CORS

---

# 3. System Results
